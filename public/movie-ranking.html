<h1>Best Movies in Recent Memory According to Javon</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 in No Particular Order.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)</h3>
<p>
  A really good Sci-Fi thriller that had me completely invested in the story.
</p>
<h3>The Substance (2024)</h3>
<p>
  Surprisingly good body horror/dark comedy that left me in suspense through the
  entire film!
</p>
<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022)</h3>
<p>
  A fantastic ride that featured a little bit of every genre from Martial Arts
  to Dark comedy and Action-Adventure!
